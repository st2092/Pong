# Pong
Android App 2D graphics interaction with user practice

__Description__

This application replicates the game, Pong, where the player must move the paddle to hit the ball to the other side. The ball bounces around the screen with a constant random speed each time the application starts. The paddle is at the right edge of the screen and moves in the direction the player taps on the screen. The paddle can only go up or down along the right edge of the screen.
